A tiny and super-fast SVG rendering library for Flutter.

## Getting Started
re_svg is designed for ease of use. By simply introducing the SvgView component, SVGs can be rendered correctly.
```dart
import 'package:re_svg/re_svg.dart';

// ...

SvgView(
  data: data, // string
  intrinsic: true,
)
```

- [resvg_pod](https://github.com/rustui/resvg_pod) - For the iOS platform, Flutterâ€™s local pod cannot directly download the online static library. Therefore, a new pod is created to download the resvg static library.
